# Cloud Tasks Sample Application with Native Image

The Cloud Tasks sample application demonstrates some common operations with
[Google Cloud Tasks](https://cloud.google.com/tasks) and is compatible with
Native Image compilation.

This application will create a new queue called `graal-test-queue` if it does
not already exist.
It will then submit a new task to this queue.

## Setup Instructions

1. Follow the [GCP Project and Native Image Setup Instructions](../../README.md).

2. [Enable the Cloud Tasks APIs](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/cloudtasks.googleapis.com).

### Run with Native Image Compilation

Navigate to this directory in a new terminal.

1. The project uses an environment variable `LOCATION_ID` to run the test. Set the environment variable by calling:

   ```
   export LOCATION_ID=us-east1
   ```
 
2. Compile the application using the Native Image Compiler. This step may take a few minutes.

   ```
   $ mvn package -P native
   ```

   
    
3. Run the application:

   ```
   $ ./target/tasks-sample
   ```

4. The application runs through some basic Cloud Tasks operations (create queue, create task) and then prints some results of the operations.

   ```
   Test queue ready: name: "projects/xxxxxxxxxx/locations/us-central1/queues/graal-test-queue-4009"

   max_dispatches_per_second: 500.0

   }

   }

   }

   ```

5. Run the test in the project in the native-image mode

   ```
   $ LOCATION_ID=us-east1 mvn test -P native
